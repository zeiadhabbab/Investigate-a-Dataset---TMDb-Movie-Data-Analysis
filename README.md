## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze a movie dataset to uncover trends, correlations, and insights that are valuable to the movie industry. By examining aspects such as genres, budgets, and revenue, we strive to answer key questions that help us understand what makes a movie successful and popular.

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning and Wrangling

Data preparation is a critical part of our analysis process. Our steps include:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Identifying and filling or dropping missing values.
2. **Removing Duplicates**: Ensuring unique entries for accurate analysis.
3. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**: Streamlining data by removing irrelevant columns.
4. **Adjusting Data Types**: Converting columns for optimized processing.
5. **Filtering Outliers**: Excluding rows with extreme values where necessary.

---

## ❓ Analysis Questions

Our analysis focuses on answering the following questions:

1. What are the most popular movie genres? 📽️
2. How has the average movie budget changed over the years? 💸
3. What is the average movie budget for Comic Book Movies (DC/Marvel) over time? 🦸‍♂️
4. Who are the top 10 most prolific directors? 🎥
5. What is the relationship between user ratings and popularity? ⭐
6. What percentage of movies each year had a higher-than-average revenue? 📈

## 📈 Visualizations and Insights

Each question is accompanied by relevant visualizations, helping to highlight key findings:

- **Popular Genres**: A bar chart of the top movie genres by frequency.
- **Average Movie Budget Over the Years**: A line chart showing budget trends.
- **Comic Book Movie Budgets**: Analysis of DC and Marvel budgets over time.
- **Top Directors**: A bar chart of the most prolific directors.
- **User Ratings vs. Popularity**: A scatter plot to explore correlations.
- **Percentage of High-Revenue Movies**: Line chart showing yearly revenue trends.

Each visualization is followed by a reasoning section to interpret the results and highlight significant insights.

## 📉 Limitations and Further Research

While this analysis provides valuable insights, there are limitations:

1. **Data Completeness**: Some rows have missing values in important columns like `budget` and `revenue`.
2. **Correlation vs. Causation**: Our analysis shows relationships but does not imply causation.
3. **Dataset Scope**: This dataset may not fully represent the entire movie industry.

Future analyses could focus on more in-depth studies of cast impact, seasonal trends, or additional statistical tests.
